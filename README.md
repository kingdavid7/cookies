Girl Scout Cookie Order
We have all been there, the irresistible face of a cute kid selling tasty cookies. They’re everywhere… at the store, knocking on the door, in the parking lot… Your objective is to create an ArrayList project that keeps track of the variety of cookie you ordered and the quantity. You will also keep track of your total number of boxes purchased. You are going to give the program the ability to remove a variety from the list just remember this may make the girl scout sad so please be kind.

The CookieOrder Class
Write this class to keep track of 2 pieces of instance data: variety of cookie and numBoxes purchased
Create the constructor to handle this data and 2 accessor methods
The MasterOrder Class will maintain a list of cookies being purchased
Declare your ArrayList and name it orders
Create an empty constructor and the following methods
public void addOrder(CookieOrder theOrder) add an order to the list showing variety and quantity
public int getTotalBoxes() keep track of total boxes ordered
public void removeVariety(String variety) give the ability to pick out a variety of cookie and remove it from the list. Hint: When you remove something the list will shrink, you need to consider this when traversing your collection (you don’t want to overlook any items)
public int getVarietyBoxes(String variety) returns the total boxes of a given variety.
public void showOrder() to traverse and print the ArrayList
The OrderApp Class
Add 4 orders
Total the boxes purchased
Show the list
Remove a variety and give feedback on how many boxes were removed
Show the updated list
Example
Current Order
Variety: Tagalongs Boxes: 1
Variety: Thin Mints Boxes: 5
Variety: Samoas Boxes: 2
Variety: Tagalongs Boxes: 3

You have ordered 11 boxes

What would you like to remove? (specify a variety or none)
Thin Mints
You are removing 5 Thin Mints
Current Order
Variety: Tagalongs Boxes: 1
Variety: Samoas Boxes: 2
Variety: Tagalongs Boxes: 3
Stretch Task
Try doing live adds, removals and updates to your order, you will need a loop and some user input
Stretchier Task
Specify a variety of cookie you want to remove and exactly how many boxes need to be removed (now you are dealing with 2 parameters(requirements))
